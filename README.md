# swirlnet

This library evolves neural networks that may perform well at some control
tasks.

It is quite similar to NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies), but some
of its features are not implemented.
For an incomplete list of differences, refer to the `VS-NEAT.md` file.

## Status

The API of swirlnet is currently unstable.

## Use

See the `API.md` file for a description of the API.

See the `test/xor.js` file for a demonstration of swirlnet's capability.

    $ node ./test/xor.js
