# swirljs

This library evolves neural networks that may perform well at certain control tasks.

It is quite similar to NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies), but some
of its features have not been implemented.

The API of swirljs is currently unstable.

## Usage

See the `xor.js` file for a demonstration of swirljs' capability.

    $ nodejs ./test/xor.js
